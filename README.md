# PingResponseLog

This is a little tool to ping a given list of addresses (IPv4, IPv6, DNS name) in a definable interval of time and log the responses in an also definable file.

! https://github.com/evilbaschdi/EvilBaschdi.Core is required for this project !
The recommended way is to store / clone both repositories in the same root directory.
Next step would be to open and restore the nuget packages of EvilBaschdi.Core project.

Now you can open and rebuild the PingResponseLog project. The EvilBaschdi.Core project will be rebuild automatically as a pre-build step of PingResponseLog.
